      <h1>Welcome to International Institute of Information Technology (I²IT)</h1>
      <p>
        The International Institute of Information Technology (I²IT), Pune pronounced as I Square IT] was founded by the visionary Late Shri. P. P. Chhabria, the Founder Chairman of the Finolex Group of Companies, A respected industrialist, philanthropist, and former President of the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA), Shri Chhabria envisioned a world-class institute that would serve as a hub for excellence in education, research, and innovation.
Established on a sprawling 10-acre campus in Pune, IRIT was conceived as a premier academy dedicated to imparting cutting-edge education in Engineering, Information Technology, and emerging areas of technological expertise. The institute continually evolves to meet the dynamic demands of industry, encouraging students to become future-ready professionals equipped to tackle real-world challenges.
It proudly upholds the ethos of "Innovation and Leadership' as its guiding mantra-fostering a culture where groundbreaking ideas are nurtured, and transformative thinking is encouraged. The institution aims to cultivate not just academic brilliance, but also strong moral values and leadership capabilities among its students.
The campus itself is a reflection of this vision. Designed by world-renowned architects, its iconic dome-shaped structure stands as a symbol of enlightenment and knowledge—a true temple of learning. With state-of-the-art infrastructure, well-equipped laboratories, and a vibrant academic environment, IT is committed to delivering holistic education that empowers students to become innovators, leaders, and changemakers of tomorrow.
